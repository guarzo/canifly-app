## Overview

**Can I Fly** is an application that helps EVE Online players quickly determine which ships their characters can pilot and what training they need to reach their goals. By integrating directly with EVE's APIs, **Can I Fly** lets you manage characters, skill plans, and account mappings from a single, intuitive interface. The tool also helps you configure local EVE profiles, sync settings, and back up or restore them effortlessly.

## Key Features

- **Character Management:**  
  Add, remove, and organize your EVE Online characters by account, role, or location. Use the character overview page to see training statuses, skill points, and quick details at a glance.

- **Skill Plans:**  
  View, create, and delete skill plans. Instantly see which characters qualify for specific plans, which are pending, and which require more training. Easily copy skill plans for sharing or backup.

- **Mapping & Syncing:**  
  Associate character files with local user files for seamless syncing of in-game settings. Drag and drop characters to user files, and use the dashboard and mapping pages to ensure all accounts and characters have the right configuration.

- **Integrated Instructions & Tooltips:**  
  Each page (e.g., Character Overview, Skill Plans) includes a built-in instructions toggle. Simply click the help icon to show or hide guidance on how to use that page’s features.

## Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.22.3 or newer. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

- **Callback & Secret Key:**  
  Set `EVE_CALLBACK_URL` to the callback URL configured in your EVE developer application.  
  Generate a secret key for encryption:
  ```sh
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
  Use this output as `SECRET_KEY`.
